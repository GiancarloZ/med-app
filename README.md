# MED-APP

Welcome to your MED-APP! Sign up as a doctor and create you username and password to log in. Once logged in as a doctor you will enter your portal. You will be able to see all of your patients. When you click on a patient, you will see their information and all the medications you prescribe them. Feel free to edit your patient information as well as the medications you need to prescribe. If a medication is not listed, add a medication to the Medication Database and add it to your patient. If you need to change some account settings, click on the Account tab in shortcut sidebar and change your first name, last name, and/or email, or delete account entirely. When signing up as a patient, you will be able to choose your account information (i.e. Name, email, username, password) as well as the doctor of your choosing. When logged in, you will be able to see who your doctor is and the medications they prescribe  you. Head on over to the Account tab of your shortcut sidebar and you will be able to update your account information as well as delete your account.
